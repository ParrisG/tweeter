# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page AJAX-based Twitter clone.

This project was created in the educational environment of Lighthouse Labs, and uses jQuery, HTML5, and plain ol' CSS3. As such, it is not intended for commercial use.

This project also utilizes responsive design elements, with the mobile view for screens less than 1024px and the laptop/desktop view for screens 1024px and above.
